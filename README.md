# THE FROGPAD
## a frog-themed macropad 

This is a 3x3 macropad I made for Highway/Undercity/Hackpad! I really like keyboards and frogs which is why I chose to make this project. 
There are 9 switches in all. Also, there is a rotary encoder in case I want to add anything later. I used KMK firmware.
I did make a PCB project for the Trail, but it has been a while since I made another PCB, so it was pretty cool. I went to Meghana's hackpad workshop for it.
Also, this was my first time using Onshape and Fusion360. I started with Onshape then quit and moved to Fusion360. It was a little difficult to start, but then I got the hang of it.
